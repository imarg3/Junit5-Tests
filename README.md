# Junit5-Tests
JUnit is most popular Java Unit Testing Framework. The new version of JUnit - Junit 5 or Jupiter is even more special.

## Test Driven Development

Software projects involve a lot of uncertainties. We work with new technologies, 
ever-changing requirements, people movement, or a combination of these. To overcome 
the fear and manage these uncertainties, we need a software development practice that 
can help us produce working software. It must keep things simple and provide us quick 
feedback in case things go wrong.

Test-driven development, rediscovered by Kent Beck in 2003, is a development 
practice that increases developer confidence by advocating tests for all software 
requirements. It makes us work in short (a few minutes) incremental development cycles, 
thus providing quick feedback on our progress. TDD forces us to write a failing test before 
writing the production code. The complete process looks as follows:

1. Add a test for the new functionality or behavior.
2. See it fail.
3. Write enough code to make the test pass.
4. Make sure all the previous tests pass as well.
5. Refactor the code.
6. Repeat until done.

The key part here is writing a failing test first. The test specifies our understanding 
of the system. We are writing what we expect the system will do when some action is 
performed. This helps us to clearly understand the system.

We should focus on the test-first approach of TDD. There are many programmers 
who write test last. We think the test-last approach does not help you achieve the full 
benefit of TDD. TDD is sometimes called test-driven design (i.e., tests should help you to 
design the system). The design part of TDD is more important than the testing part. When 
we do test last, we donâ€™t reap the design benefit from the practice.

In software development, quick feedback is the key to software productivity. TDD 
gives us quick feedback that we are moving in the right direction. In a way, it keeps our 
mind focused and positive. We believe in our code as it is meeting end user expectations 
written in tests.

TDD helps us achieve two important goals:
- Detect regression errors.
- Keep system design simple.
